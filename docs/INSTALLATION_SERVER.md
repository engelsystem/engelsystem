#Installation of Engelsystem on a Server

## Requirements:
 * PHP 5.4.x (cgi-fcgi)
 * MySQL-Server 5.5.x
 * Webserver, i.e. lighttpd, nginx, or Apache

## Directions:
 * Clone the master branch with the submodules: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/fossasia/engelsystem.git`
 * Webserver must have write access to the 'import' directory and read access for all other directories
 * Webserver must be public.

 * Recommended: Directory Listing should be disabled.
 * There must a be MySQL database created with a user who has full rights to that database.
 * It must be created by the db/install.sql and db/update.sql files.
 * If necessary, create a config/config.php to override values from config/config.default.php.
 * In the browser, login with credentials admin:asdfasdf and change the password.

Engelsystem can now be used.

## Session Settings:
 * Make sure the config allows for sessions.
 * Both Apache and Nginx allow for different VirtualHost configurations.

##Steps:

*  clone the repository (the recursive parameter allows us to clone the submodules):                           git clone --recursive [*https://github.com/fossasia/engelsystem.git*](https://github.com/fossasia/engelsystem.git)

*  Compress the downloaded repository in .zip format

*  Upload the compressed file to the server either using the file manager of the CPanel (or Vista Panel) provided by the hosting server or use any FTP client (E.g. FileZilla, etc.)

*  Extract the components in the directory (public\_html)

*  Next, configure your Engelsystem database:



1.  Create a database for the Engelsystem (give any name to it)

2.  Open phpMyAdmin on the server to create tables in the database

3.  In phpMyAdmin select the database created and click on the import tab to import the tables and schema for the Engelsystem

4.  Import the “install.sql” and “update.sql” to finish configuring the database for the Engelsystem



*  We must make sure to point our Apache document root to the Engelsystem directory to prevent any user from accessing anything other than the public/ directory for security reasons. Do this by modifying the Apache configuration file using the SSH access and edit the following file:

    \#vim /var/cpanel/userdata/USERNAME/DOMAINNAME.COM

    Change USERNAME with the CPanel username and DOMAINNAME with the primary domainname.

*  After editing file, search for text *documentroot* and change the path as:

    documentroot: /home/USERNAME/public\_html/\[Engelsystem directory\]/public

*  After making changed, we need to rebuid Apache configuration file and restart Apache server. Use the following command to do it.

    \# /scripts/rebuildhttpdconf

    \# service httpd restart
    The changes will be permanently updated. Check your site for reflecting changes. For more help on changing the documentroot in CPanel, please visit [here](http://tecadmin.net/how-to-change-document-root-of-primary-domain-in-cpanel/) .

## Setting up Captcha  
*  For setting up captcha for the online server, we need to signup for reCaptcha API keys. The keys are unique to the domain or domains you specify, and their respective sub-domains. Specifying more than one domain could come in handy in the case that you serve your website from multiple top level domains (for example: yoursite.com, yoursite.net).
*  Visit the link,http://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#whyrecaptcha , and sign up for the reCaptcha API keys.
*  After we sign-up for the reCaptcha for the domain, we'll be provided with 2 keys, Public Key(DataSite Key) and a Private Key (Secret key).
*  We must change the existing keys, Do this by modifying the file `config.php`.
*  User can enable/disable reCaptcha by setting `capflg` in `config.php` as `true`/`false`.

If you made it this far without any issues, **congratulations!** You have successfully set up Engelsystem on your domain and can use it to manage your event.

##Session Settings:

-   Make sure the config allows for sessions.

-   Both Apache and Nginx allow for different VirtualHost configurations.
