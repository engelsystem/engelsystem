## Code style

* Make sure your code follows the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) code style.
You may use `composer run phpcs` to verify that.
* Use `use` statements wherever possible instead of writing the fully qualified name.
* Order the composer/npm dependencies alphabetically.
* Do not use code from the [includes](./includes) directory anywhere else.
* If possible cover your code by test cases.
